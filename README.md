# Discord Bot Templates
This repository contains templates for PyCord discord bots.

It is pretty outdated and was just in one of my folders so I thought of myself, why don't I just make a repo?

## How To:
You will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (obviously), [PyCord](https://pycord.dev/) for the framework of the bot and [ruamel.yaml](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/) for the configuration.

After you finished installing all of these necessities, clone the repository and fill up **config.template.yml**

Once you finished up filling the configuration file, you can go ahead and remove the **".template"** in every file, so it looks neat to look at.

You can now start building your discord bot on top of the template!
